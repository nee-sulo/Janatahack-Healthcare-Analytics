Objective: The task is to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient on case by case basis so that the Hospitals can use this information for optimal resource allocation and better functioning. The length of stay is divided into 11 different classes ranging from 0-10 days to more than 100 days.

Data Description                                                          
train.csv – File containing features related to patient, hospital and Length of stay on case basis                            
train_data_dict.csv – File containing the information of the features in train file                               
test.csv – File containing features related to patient, hospital. Need to predict the Length of stay for each case_id                               

Synopsis:                                                                                
• Data preprocessing techiniques like data cleaning, binning, label encoding and visualisation                                                       
• Machine/Statistical learning techniques like Hyperparameter tuning, Cross validation, RandomizedSearchCV, LightGBM, CatBoost and Voting Classifeir                 

Outcome: A multi-class classification model with an accuracy of ~42%.                                                       

Achievement:
